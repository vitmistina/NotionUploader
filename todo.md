Upgrading to Version 2025-09-03
Learn how to upgrade your Notion API integrations to the latest API version

Suggest Edits
We’ve released Notion API version 2025‑09‑03, introducing first-class support for multi-source databases. This enables a single database to contain multiple linked data sources — unlocking powerful new workflows.

For more information about data sources, see our FAQs.

However, this change is not backwards-compatible. Most existing database integrations must be updated to prevent disruptions.

❗️
Code changes required

If your integration is still using a previous API version and a user adds another data source to a database, the following API actions will fail:

Create page when using the database as the parent
Database read, write, or query
Writing relation properties that point to that database
What’s changing
Most API operations that used database_id now require a data_source_id
Several database endpoints have moved or been restructured to support the new data model

A breakdown of what’s new and why it changed
A step-by-step migration checklist to safely update your integrations
Upgrade checklist
Use this checklist to see exactly what must change before you bump Notion-Version to 2025-09-03.

Required steps across all of your integrations
Add a discovery step to fetch and store the data_source_id to use in subsequent API calls.
Start sending data_source_id when creating pages or defining relations
Migrate database endpoints to data sources.
If you use the Search API, update result handling to process data source objects and possible multiple results per database
If using the TypeScript SDK, upgrade to the correct version and set the new version in your client
If using webhooks, handle the new shape and bump your subscription version
📘
Developer action required

These steps primarily require code changes in your repositories or low-code platform. They cannot be fully completed through the Notion integration management UI.

Step-by-step guide
Step 1: Add a discovery step to fetch and store the data_source_id
First, identify the parts of your system that process database IDs. These may include:

Responses of list and search APIs, e.g. Search.
Database IDs provided directly by users of your system, or hard-coded based on URLs in the Notion app.
Events for integration webhooks (covered in the Webhook changes section below).
For each entry point that uses database IDs, start your migration process by introducing an API call to the new Get Database API (GET /v1/databases/:database_id) endpoint to retrieve a list of child data_sources. For this new call, make sure to use the 2025-09-03 version in the Notion-Version header, even if the rest of your API calls haven't been updated yet.

Get Database (JSON)
Get Database (JS SDK)

// GET /v1/databases/{database_id}
// Notion-Version: "2025-09-03"
// --- RETURNS -->
{
  "object": "database",
  "id": "{database_id}",
  "title": [/* ... */],
  "parent": {
    "type": "page_id",
    "page_id": "255104cd-477e-808c-b279-d39ab803a7d2"
  },
  "is_inline": false,
  "in_trash": false,
  "created_time": "2025-08-07T10:11:07.504-07:00",
  "last_edited_time": "2025-08-10T15:53:11.386-07:00",
  "data_sources": [
    {
      "id": "{data_source_id}",
      "name": "My Task Tracker"
    }
  ],
  "icon": null,
  "cover": null,
  // ...
}
To get a data source ID in the Notion app, the settings menu for a database includes a "Copy data source ID" button under "Manage data sources":


Having access to the data source ID (or rather, IDs, once Notion users start adding 2nd sources for their existing databases) for a database lets you continue onto the next few steps.

Step 2: Provide data source IDs when creating pages or relations
Some APIs that accept database_id in the body parameters now support providing a specific data_source_id instead. This works for any API version, meaning you can switch over at your convenience, before or after upgrading these API requests to use 2025-09-03:

Creating a page with a database (now: data source) parent
Defining a database relation property that points to another database (now: data source)
Create page
In the Create a page API, look for calls that look like this:

Create Page (JSON)
Create Page (TS SDK)

// POST /v1/pages
{
  "parent": {
    "type": "database_id",
    "database_id": "..."
  }
}
Change these to use data_source_id parents instead, using the code from Step 1 to get the ID of a database's data source:

Create Page (JSON)
Create Page (TS SDK)

// POST /v1/pages
{
  "parent": {
    "type": "data_source_id",
    "data_source_id": "..."
  }
}
Create or update database
For database relation properties, the API will include both a database_id and data_source_id fields in the read path instead of just a database_id.

In the write path, switch your integration to only provide the data_source_id in request objects.

Relation property response example

"Projects": {
  "id": "~pex",
  "name": "Projects",
  "type": "relation",
  "relation": {
    "database_id": "6c4240a9-a3ce-413e-9fd0-8a51a4d0a49b",
    "data_source_id": "a42a62ed-9b51-4b98-9dea-ea6d091bc508",
    "dual_property": {
      "synced_property_name": "Tasks",
      "synced_property_id": "JU]K"
    }
  }
}
Note that database mentions in rich text will continue to reference the database, not the data source.

Step 3: Migrate database endpoints to data sources
The next step is to migrate each existing use of database APIs to their new data source equivalents, taking into account the differences between the old /v1/databases APIs and new /v1/data_sources APIs:

Return very similar responses, but with object: "data_source", starting from 2025-09-03
Accept a specific data source ID in query, body, and path parameters, not a database ID
Exist under the /v1/data_sources namespace, starting from version 2025-09-03
Require a custom API request with notion.request if you're using the TypeScript SDK, since we won't upgrade to SDK v5 until you get to Step 4 (below).
The following APIs are affected. Each of them is covered by a sub-section below, with more specific Before vs. After explanations and code snippets:

Retrieve a database
Query a database
Create a database
Update a database
Search
Retrieve database
Before (2022-06-28):

Retrieving a database with multiple data sources fails with a validation_error message.
For relation properties: across all API versions, both the database_id and data_source_id are now included in the response object.
Retrieve Database (JSON)
Query Database (TS SDK)

// GET /v1/databases/:database_id
{
  // ...
}
After (2025-09-03):

The Retrieve Database API is now repurposed to return a list of data_sources (each with an id and name, as described in Step 1).
The Retrieve Data Source API is the new home for getting up-to-date information on the properties (schema) of each data source under a database.
The object field is always "data_source" and the id is specific to the data source.
The parent object now identifies the database_id immediate parent of the data source.
The database's parent (i.e. the data source's grandparent) is included as a separate field, database_parent, on the data source response.
You can't use a database ID with the retrieve data source API, or vice-versa. The two types of IDs are not interchangeable.
Retrieve Data Source (JSON)
Retrieve Data Source (TS SDK)

// Get `data_source_id` from Step 1
//
// GET /v1/data_sources/:data_source_id
{
  "object": "data_source",
  "id": "bc1211ca-e3f1-4939-ae34-5260b16f627c",
  "created_time": "2021-07-08T23:50:00.000Z",
  "last_edited_time": "2021-07-08T23:50:00.000Z",
  "properties": {
    "In stock": {
      "id": "fk%5EY",
      "name": "In stock",
      "type": "checkbox",
      "checkbox": {}
    },
    "Name": {
      "id": "title",
      "name": "Name",
      "type": "title",
      "title": {}
    }
  },
  "parent": {
    "type": "database_id",
    "database_id": "6ee911d9-189c-4844-93e8-260c1438b6e4"
  },
  "database_parent": {
    "type": "page_id",
    "page_id": "98ad959b-2b6a-4774-80ee-00246fb0ea9b"
  },
  // ... (other properties omitted)
}
Query databases
Before (2022-06-28):

Query Database (JSON)
Query Database (TS SDK)

// PATCH /v1/databases/:database_id/query
{
  // ...
}
After (2025-09-03):

When you update the API version, the path of this API changes, and now accepts a data source ID. With the TS SDK, you'll have to switch this to temporarily use a custom notion.request(...), until you upgrade to the next major version as part of Step 4.

Query Data Source (JSON)
Query Data Source (TS SDK)

// PATCH /v1/data_sources/:data_source_id/query
{
  // ...
}
Create database
Before (2022-06-28):

In 2022-06-28, the Create Database API created a database and data source, along with its initial default view.
For relation properties: across all API versions, both the database_id and data_source_id are now included in the response object.
When providing relation properties in a request, you can either use database_id, data_source_id, or both, prior to making the API version upgrade.
We recommend starting by switching your integration over to passing only a data_source_id for relation objects even in 2022-06-28 to precisely identify the data source to use for the relation and be ready for the 2025-09-03 behavior.
Create Database (JSON)
Create Database (TS SDK)

// POST /v1/databases
{
  "parent": {"type": "page_id", "page_id": "..."},
  "properties": {...},
  // ...
}
After (2025-09-03):

Continue to use the Create Database API even after upgrading, when you want to create both a database and its initial data source.
properties for the initial data source you're creating now go under initial_data_source[properties] to better separate data source specific properties vs. ones that apply to the entire database.
Other parameters apply to the database and continue to be specified at the top-level when creating a database (icon, cover, title).
Only use the new Create Data Source API to add an additional data source (with a new set of properties) to an existing database.
For relation properties: You can no longer provide a database_id. Notion continues to include both the database_id and data_source_id in the response for convenience, but the request object must only contain data_source_id.
Create Database with initial data source (JSON)
Create Database with initial data source (TS SDK)

// POST /v1/databases
{
  "initial_data_source": {
    "properties": {
      // ... (Data source properties behave the same as database properties previously)
    }
  },
  "parent": {"type": "workspace", "workspace": true} | {"type": "page_id", "page_id": "..."},
  "title": [...],
  "icon": {"type": "emoji", "emoji": "🚀"} | ...
}
Update database
Before (2022-06-28):

In 2022-06-28, the Update Database API was used to update attributes that related to both a database and its data source under the hood. For example, is_inline relates to the database, but properties defines the schema of a specific data source.
For relation properties: across all API versions, both the database_id and data_source_id are now included in the response object.
When providing relation properties in a request, you can either use database_id, data_source_id, or both, prior to making the API version upgrade.
We recommend starting by switching your integration over to passing only a data_source_id for relation objects even in 2022-06-28 to precisely identify the data source to use for the relation and be ready for the 2025-09-03 behavior.
Update Database (JSON)
Update Database (TS SDK)

// PATCH /v1/databases/:database_id
{
  "icon": {
    "file_upload": {"id": "..."}
  },
  "properties": {
    "Restocked (new)": {
      "type": "checkbox",
      "checkbox": {}
    },
    "In stock": null
  },
  "title": [{"text": {"content": "New Title"}}]
}
After (2025-09-03):

Continue to use the Update Database API for attributes that apply to the database: parent, title, is_inline, icon, cover, in_trash.
parent can be used to move an existing database to a different page, or (for public integrations), to the workspace level as a private page. This is a new feature in Notion's API.
cover is not supported when is_inline is true.
Switch over to the Update Data Source API to modify attributes that apply to a specific data source: properties (to change database schema), in_trash (to archive or unarchive a specific data source under a database), title.
Changes to one data source's properties doesn't affect the schema for other data source, even if they share a common database.
For relation properties: You can no longer provide a database_id. Notion continues to include both the database_id and data_source_id in the response for convenience, but the request object (to Update Data Source) must only contain data_source_id.
Example for updating a data source's title and properties (adding one new property and removing another):

Update Data Source (JSON)
Update Data Source (TS SDK)

// PATCH /v1/data_sources/:data_source_id
{
  "properties": {
    "Restocked (new)": {
      "type": "checkbox",
      "checkbox": {}
    },
    "In stock": null
  },
  "title": [{"text": {"content": "New Title"}}]
}
Example for updating a database's parent (to move it), and switch it to be inline under the parent page:

Update Data Source (JSON)
Update Data Source (TS SDK)

// PATCH /v1/databases/:database_id
{
  "parent": {"type": "page_id", "page_id": "NEW-PAGE-ID"},
  "is_inline": true
}
Step 4: Handle search results with data sources
Before (2022-06-28):

If any Notion users add a second data source to a database, existing integrations will not see any search results for that database.
After (2025-09-03):

The Search API now only accepts filter["value"] = "page" | "data_source" instead of "page" | "database" when providing a filter["type"] = "object". Make sure to update the body parameters accordingly when upgrading to 2025-09-03.
Currently, the search behavior remains the same. The provided query is matched against the database title, not the data source title.
Similarly, the search API response returns data source IDs & objects.
Aside from the IDs and object: "data_source" in these entries, the rest of the object shape of search is unchanged.
Since results operate at the data source level, they continue to include properties (database schema) as before.
If there are multiple data sources, all of them are included in the search response. Each of them will have a different data source ID.
Step 5: Upgrade SDK (if applicable)
📘
Introducing @notionhq/client v5

v5 of the SDK is now available:

NPM link
GitHub release link
If you see an even newer version (e.g. v5.0.2) at the time you're following these steps, we recommend upgrading directly to the latest version to unlock more enhancements and bugfixes, making the upgrade smoother.

If you're using Notion's TypeScript SDK, and have completed all of the steps above to rework your usage of Notion's endpoints to fit the 2025-09-03 suite of endpoints manually, we recommend completing the migration by upgrading to the next major version release, v5.0.0, via your package.json file (or other version management toolchain.)

The code snippets under Step 3 include the relevant syntax for the new notion.dataSources.* and notion.databases.* methods to assist in your upgrade. Go through each area where you used a manual notion.request(...) call, and switch it over to use one of the dedicated methods. Make sure you're setting the Notion version at initialization time to 2025-09-03.

Note that the List databases (deprecated) endpoint, which has been removed since version 2022-02-22, is no longer included as of v5 of the SDK.

Step 6: Upgrade webhooks (if applicable)
Introducing webhook versioning
When creating, editing, or viewing an integration webhook subscription in Notion's integration settings, there's a new option to set the API version that applies to events delivered to your webhook URL:

Screenshot of the integration webhook "Edit subscription" form, with the new "API version" dropdown menu.
Screenshot of the integration webhook "Edit subscription" form, with the new "API version" dropdown menu.

For new webhook endpoints, we recommend starting with the most recent version. For existing webhook subscriptions, you'll need to carefully introduce support for the added and changed webhook types. Ensure your webhook handler can accept both old & new event payloads before using the "Edit subscription" form to upgrade to the 2025-09-03 API version.

After you've tested your webhook endpoint to ensure the new events are being handled correctly for some period of time (for example, a few hours), you can clean up your system to only expect events with the updated shape. Read on below for specific details on what's changed in 2025-09-03.

New and modified event types
New data_source specific events have been added, and the corresponding existing database events now apply at the database level.

Here's a breakdown of how event types change names or behavior when upgraded to 2025-09-03:

Old Name	New Name	Description
database.content_updated	data_source.content_updated	Data source's content updates
database.schema_updated	data_source.schema_updated	Data source's schema updates
N/A (new event)	data_source.created	New data source is added to an existing database

entity.type is "data_source"
N/A (new event)	data_source.moved	Data source is moved to a different database

entity.type is "data_source"
N/A (new event)	data_source.deleted	Data source is deleted from a database

entity.type is "data_source"
N/A (new event)	data_source.undeleted	Data source is undeleted

entity.type is "data_source"
database.created	(unchanged)	New database is created with a default data source
database.moved	(unchanged)	Database is moved to different parent (i.e. page)
database.deleted	(unchanged)	Database is deleted from its parent
database.undeleted	(unchanged)	Database is undeleted
Updates to parent data
With the 2025-09-03 version, all webhooks for entities that can have data sources as parents now include a new field data_source_id under the data.parent object.

This applies to:

Page events (page.*)
Data source events (the data_source.* ones listed above)
Database events (database.*), but only in rarer cases where databases are directly parented by another database (i.e. wikis)
For example, when a Notion user creates a page within a data source using the Notion app, the resulting page.created event has the following example shape (note the new data.parent.data_source_id field):

JSON

{
  "id": "367cba44-b6f3-4c92-81e7-6a2e9659efd4",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-05T23:55:34.285Z",

    },
    {
      "id": "1edc05f6-2702-81b5-8408-00279347f034",
      "type": "bot"
    }
  ],
  "attempt_number": 1,
  "entity": {

  },
  "data": {
    "parent": {
      "id": "36cc9195-760f-4fff-a67e-3a46c559b176",
      "type": "database",
      "data_source_id": "98024f3c-b1d3-4aec-a301-f01e0dacf023"
    }
  }
}
For compatibility with multi-source databases, use the provided parent.data_source_id to distinguish which data source the page lives in.
