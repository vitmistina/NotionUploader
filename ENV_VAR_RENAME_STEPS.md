# Environment Variable Rename Steps

To align with the new centralized settings, rename the following environment variables:

1. `LLM_Update` → `NOTION_SECRET`
2. `CLIENT_ID` → `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`
3. `CUSTOMER_SECRET` → `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`

Update your `.env` file or deployment environment accordingly.
